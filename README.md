# Bellabeat-Case-Study

Bellabeat is a high-tech company founded in 2013 by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur. They are a manufacturer of health-focused smart products for women. By collecting data on activity, sleep, stress and reproductive health, Bellabeat empowered women with knowledge about their health and habits. Bellabeat is a successful small company that has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market.

As a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, I’ve been asked to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. The insights derived would be used to provide high-level recommendations that will guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
